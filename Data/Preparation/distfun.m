function D2 = distfun(ZI, ZJ)
%UNTITLED Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here
% taking as arguments a 1-by-n vector ZI containing a single observation from 
%X or Y, an m2-by-n matrix ZJ containing multiple observations from X or Y, 
%and returning an m2-by-1 vector of distances D2, whose Jth element is the 
%distance between the observations ZI and ZJ(J,:).
